First, you must be ready to act. Most behaviors we want to change are habit patterns and are very hard to change.

Then, you must convince yourself you really want it so the cost to benefit justifies the effort.

Next, you must prepare and plan for success including preventing relapse to old habits, putting supports in place and addressing any negative thinking about success as well as you beliefs, experiences and expectations.

Write measurable goals that are challenging yet attainable and update them weekly.

Ensure you have self efficacy and pisitive expectations in your success.

Rejoice at success along the way.

Journal or keep a log to promote self accountability.

Act 10 weeks successfully to initiate the new habit, tie performance to existing cues to increase success..

Continue acting 2 to 5 years until the new healthier behavior is habituated.Hello
